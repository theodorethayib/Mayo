-2 through 2 --> do not plot
-2 through -5 --> light blue to dark blue
2 thorugh 5 --> light red to dark red
Set thresholds as variables


Transparent electrodes/brain (.05?) (DONE is a variable - adjust as needed)
Grey background (DONE)

Interpolation/Upsampling (interp1?) (use either 3x or 4x interp?) --> Spline https://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/ref/interp1.html
https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/answers/314146-interpolation-between-sequnce-of-images

Show when "word on" "word off" etc

Show color scale at bottom(?) of the graph --> Look at Colorbar

Work with tight_subplot for plotting (DONE)

How do we want the graphs labeled?

Run program with all patients etc. 
Maybe create a "config" file with all changable variables?

Work on optimization

INTERP:
4 frames of fade-out while next picture fades in

Use plot3 instead of scatter3? (Seems faster)
	Look into transparency for makers (undocumented) --> http://undocumentedmatlab.com/blog/plot-markers-transparency-and-color-gradient
		https://stackoverflow.com/questions/35069788/inconsistent-behavior-with-undocumented-matlab-figure-handles/35070679#35070679
		Check how much slower it is with transparency vs without transparency (and see how it compares to scatter3 too)


Maybe look into plotting all points at once vs for loop (storing location and color data in a 3d matrix - one for each frequency?)

3,753,816 electrodes to look at total, 887,578 of which are plotted
