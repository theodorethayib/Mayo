Frequency 1-6
	Time 1-44
		Patients 1-139
			Electrodes 1-72

Plot brain before electrodes - movie will be weird if not

Threshold currently at +-.2
If above/below threshold then plot
	When plotting, need to reference all_loc

Start with one time first



Create matrix: x value | y value | z value | power

Different figure for each frequency band (displayed at once)

COLOR THRESHOLDS: -0.5, 0.5

What different views do we want?
