Frequency 1-6
	Patients 1-139
		Time 1-44
			Electrodes 1-72


Start with patient 1, run through all times and plot electrodes

Threshold currently at +-0.05
If above/below threshold then plot
	When plotting, need to reference all_loc

Start with one time first



Create matrix: x value | y value | z value | power

Different figure for each frequency band (displayed at once)
Different figure for each time 

Name figures as: FrequencyBand_ViewNumber_Time

For each electrode
