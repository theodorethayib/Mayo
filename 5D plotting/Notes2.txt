Start with patient 1, run through all times and plot electrodes

Threshold currently at +-.2
If above/below threshold then plot
	When plotting, need to reference all_loc

Start with one time first



Create matrix: x value | y value | z value | power

Different figure for each frequency band (displayed at once)
Different figure for each time 

Name figures as: FrequencyBand_ViewNumber_Time

For each electrode


COLOR THRESHOLDS: -0.5, 05
